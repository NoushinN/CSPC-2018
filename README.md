# 1. About CSPC
Established in 2009, the [Canadian Science Policy Conference (CSPC)](https://sciencepolicy.ca/cspc-2018) meets an important need for a non-partisan, inclusive, national dialogue on science, technology and innovation policy. Our vision is to ensure systematic connections between Canada’s diverse scientific enterprises and policymakers in scientific enterprises and policymakers in political spheres, both federally and provincially.
The CSPC has become Canada’s most comprehensive, multi-sectorial and multi-disciplinary annual science policy forum and attracted numerous politicians and hundreds of professionals from industry, academia, the non-profit sector, federal and provincial governments every year. The conference has traveled across Canada: Toronto (2009), Montreal (2010), Ottawa (2011), Calgary (2012), Toronto (2013), Halifax (2014), Ottawa (2015, 2016, 2017) and returns to Ottawa in 2018. The [Canadian Science Policy Fellows](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/newsroom/news-release/laboratory-legislature-fellowship-deploys-23-researchers-government) were invited by Mitacs Canada to attend this conference as part of their fellowship.  In the spirit of open science, Canadian Science Policy Fellow participants are trying to make this conference as **open, accessible, and user-friendly** as possible. This repo will store conference notes from participants who have agreed to share their summary notes, and also serves as a mechanism to receive feedback in the form of issues (please see the code of conduct).
